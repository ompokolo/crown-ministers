        <div class="content">
          <p>The Crown Ministers Kisii Kenya was formed in year 2018 December by a group of talented individuals with a shared passion of spreading the gospel through music. The group’s journey began in Nyambaria National Boys School during a Nyamira Division Adventist Youth Congress where the founding members discovered a harmonious blend of voices during casual jam sessions.
            Motivated by our love for music we decided to pursue it more seriously. Early on, we performed at local events and local churches gaining recognition for our unique genre and engaging performances.
            We adopted the name The Crown Ministers Kisii Kenya symbolizing what all the chosen ones of Christ await when He comes. Over time, the lineup evolved to include different, distinctive talent and personality to the group.
            As we grew we’ve learned to compose our own original songs, inspired faith, love, patience, hope and resilience. Our dedication led to collaborations with local producers, which helped refine our craft and expand our audience. To date, we have released  7 complete albums with 22 official videos 
            Looking ahead, we aspires to reach larger audiences and leave a lasting impact on the music ministry, continuing to  spread the word to al world before Christ comes.

          <p>We thank our Lord for the far He has led us. We haven't build a church but we belong to one Nyanchwa Mission Hosipital SDA Church as part of primary founders. We have released back to back enreaching music as well yoked with other choirs to reachout to the unfortunate an take music to the non Adventist. We managed to increase our number from 20 to 30 by recruitment and baptism. We've managed to facilitate five weddings from our members.
            We look forward to save more souls build sanctuaries reach out to the unfortunate and spread more love as we sail through </p>
